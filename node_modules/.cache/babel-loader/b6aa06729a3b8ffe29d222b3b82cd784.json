For the record, I was\r\n                VERY close with the 3rd solution I'd tried the evening before, which I was quite proud of, but the feeling of finally seeing it working\r\n                that morning after so much frustration and dread that our project may be sunk was so energizing.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <hr/>\r\n\r\n            <h6>Lessons Learned</h6>\r\n            <p>\r\n                First things first, I grew markedly more comfortable with JSON and the ways it can be utilized within the infrastructure of web\r\n                development by spending so much time in the Maps API studying sample code from Google. I've always found programming to be an\r\n                exercise in being patient enough for the tumblers of the lock to click whenever you encouter new concepts or paradigms. So my\r\n                recognition and understanding of the utility of JSON really solidified over the course of this project.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                What is perhaps even more special for me though was the commitment to choosing an ambitious goal and just doing what was necessary\r\n                to get things working no matter what. And I'm happy to have had Andrew and Scott with me as they embraced the challenge in equal\r\n                measure.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <hr/>\r\n\r\n            <h6>Going Forward</h6>\r\n            <p>\r\n                I plan on adapting the concept of Carpoolify to a full stack application, partially as extra practice, but also because there are\r\n                some unique features we'd discussed including that I think I could now feasibly manage to implement. As progress is made on that front,\r\n                I'll be sure to document that progress here on my portfolio.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <hr/>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                Fun fact: The name \"Carpoolify\" as well as the color scheme for the application was inspired by Spotify\r\n                as my team members and I all shared a common admiration for its design choices and functionality\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
