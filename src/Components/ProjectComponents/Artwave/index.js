                    In the fall of 2017, I had the idea for a lightweight social media application that would focus, in particular, upon
                    the ability of people to catalogue their favorite kinds of art - from all mediums - and to recommend certain pieces
                    of art - movies, books, songs, albums, tv shows, video games, etc - directly to their friends and track that friends
                    progress experiencing whatever you had recommended to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I dubbed this idea 'artwave'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time, I lacked sufficient application development knowledge to start building anything in earnest. However, as the final
                    project loomed in the bootcamp I took this past summer, I mentioned the idea to the my partners for the project as we were
                    brainstorming what we wanted to make. They liked it and we agreed to take a stab at building it. And so, the first version of
                    ArtWave was born.
