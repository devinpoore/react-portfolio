                Perhaps it's a bit indulgent to post my portfolio as a project on my portfolio. However,
                I spent a fair amount of time contemplating what an optimized portfolio would look like
                so I mostly want to discuss

                I think part of being a good developer is spending the time to give some thought towards the
                question of "What is the point/goal of a project?" To me, it seems the point of a portfolio is to
                provide easily accessible insight into the capabilities of a developer, but also importantly, into
                the thought process of a developer.

                I have been spending a lot of time looking at job applications. Most of them ask for some combo of links to one's
                GitHub, LinkedIn, and personal website.

                GitHub is a showcase of the hard technical skills and pure code

                LinkedIn is a summary of work experience.

                It struck me that there was a relevant middle ground being missed somewhere between these two "extremes" - somewhere where
                technical knowledge could be displayed alongside a summary of the motivation that was guiding how that technical knowledge
                was being put to use.
